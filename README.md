# Texture Atlas Generator

This is a litte tool which helps creating a texture atlas if you have a flat
shaded multi-material object in Blender. Currently the add-on is only working
for Blender 2.8, because it looks for the "Principled BSDF" node in order to
determine the color of the texture tile.
